**Smart. Soft. Structured.** 
*Trauma-aware. Thoughtfully modular.*

A modular, portable, and trauma-informed AI personal assistant -- named in loving memory of OM’s cat companion, Sam Lee Catson (2007--2022).


## Philosophy

Designed with an eco-conscious mindset, Sam AI prioritizes **local-first computation** to reduce dependence on energy-intensive cloud data centers. By running models directly on user devices and supporting low-resource modular modes, Sam AI minimizes environmental impact — unlike typical AI systems reliant on large-scale centralized infrastructure.

## Features

- **Provider-Agnostic**: Choose your AI engine. Run powerful models locally for free with **Ollama** (e.g., Llama 3, Phi-3) or connect to premium APIs like **OpenAI** for maximum capability.
- **Portable Memory**: Your context, history, and preferences stay with you across devices and sessions.
- **Modular Tools**: Extend Sam's capabilities with custom tools for document analysis, workflow automation, and more.
- **Dual-Mode Operation**:
  - **Chat Mode**: For natural, supportive conversation.
  - **Agent Mode**: For multi-step reasoning and task execution.
- **Privacy-First**: Defaults to local execution. Your data never leaves your machine unless you explicitly choose a cloud API.

## Development

**Sam AI is currently in gestation — a project born from both necessity and imagination.** It began as a trauma-informed cognitive support system to help rebuild clarity, focus, and executive function after burnout. It is now evolving into a modular, portable AI assistant designed for calm logic, structured guidance, and personal context awareness. The system prioritizes local-first architecture, modular instruction sets, and emotional safety with potential applications in research workflows, recovery planning, and long-term personal organization. Preliminary code and early design components are now available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/omoreira/sam-ai).


## Disclaimer

**Sam AI is not a licensed mental health professional.** The trauma-informed features are designed for supportive self-reflection and should not be used as a substitute for therapy or professional medical advice.

## AI Assistance Disclosure

The development of Sam AI has involved the use of AI tools, including GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT (GPT-4o), and other assistant models, in the same spirit as any modern development or research environment might use IDE code completion, search engines, or documentation assistants.

These tools were used for:

- Structuring code logic and modular design patterns
- Generating boilerplate code and debugging suggestions 
- Refining documentation and organizing research materials 

However, **all architectural decisions, design logic, modular framework, and ethical vision** were conceived and guided by the human creator (Olga Moreira, PhD). Sam AI reflects lived experience, trauma-informed systems thinking, and an original editorial methodology developed over years of research and recovery.

This disclosure is offered in the interest of transparency and to acknowledge that while AI can support structured thinking and development, it does **not replace human intent, authorship, or moral responsibility**, especially in projects concerning mental well-being and personal narratives.

## In Memoriam: Sam Lee Catson

**Date:** May 4, 2022

> Goodbye, Sam! We will miss you immensely.
>
> Thank you for staying with us for over 14 years! Thank you for all the happy moments we spent together!
>
> To those who got to meet Sam in person, who knew Sam: You know that Sam wasn't an ordinary cat. He had a unique, strong personality. He was one of a kind.
>
> Sam was fearless, smart, chatty, hyperactive, friendly, and very sweet. He was a force of nature and a spoiled brat. He lived life to the fullest.
>
> Sam was stubborn, never knew when to give up. Unfortunately, his body did. His genetics betrayed him. First, his kidneys. Then, his liver. Then, his heart. One by one, his organs began shutting down while his mind was forever present, awaken. We did everything we could. Dr. Boctor and his team at the St. Catharines Animal Hospital provided the best care, the best treatment. Sam fought as hard as he could, but nature always wins in the end.
>
> Sam spent the last moments of his life at home with us. He passed away in our arms last night, knowing that we love him dearly.
>
> Wherever you are, Sam. Remember (like we always told you whenever we had to go away for a while, whenever we had to leave you at the hospital):
>
> *"Don't worry, kitty! We will come back for you. We will always will!"*

See you in Valhalla,

Olga M.
